# Budget Fadeaway: Every line item in the White House's 2016 Budget Proposal, Visualized

Every line item in the white house's 2016 budget represented by a square whose area is proportional to its size.

For the presentation, I rely on PIXI.js, a game engine which uses WebGL when available and fails gracefully into canvas rendering.
This project is born out of my [wordgalaxy](https://github.com/anthonygarvan/wordgalaxy) project.
