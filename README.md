# Budget Fadeaway 
## Every line item in the White House's 2016 budget proposal, visualized.

Every line item in the white house's 2016 budget represented by a square whose area is proportional to its size.

See it live [here](http://anthonygarvan.github.io/budgetfadeaway/).

For the presentation, I rely on PIXI.js, a game engine which uses WebGL when available and fails gracefully into canvas rendering.
This project is born out of my [wordgalaxy](https://github.com/anthonygarvan/wordgalaxy) project.
