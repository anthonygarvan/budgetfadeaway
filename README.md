# Budget Fadeaway: Every line item in the White House's 2016 Budget Proposal, Visualized

Every line item in the white house's 2016 budget represented by a square whose area is proportional to its size.

For the presentation, I rely on PIXI.js, a game engine which uses WebGL when available and fails gracefully into canvas rendering. To get a headstart, I launched off [this](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph) implementation, which is a library for plotting graphs that already had zoom & pan built in.
